    <p>Since my last blog update, not much has changed with my website's theme. The more significant changes have to do with the content
    on the site. I have started to plan out the different sections. I will be including a contact, gallery, about, and home page.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For my about page I wanted to have it look like a command prompt. It would display commands and you could input them to
    view more information. I currently have a working prototype including working commands and correcting styling. Below is an image
    of the current version I have working.</p>

    <p>For my gallery page I wanted to have it look like a github account page. I have not started development on this page,
    but I have the design.</p>

    I have not planned the two other sections, but hopefully after I finish the gallery and about pages I will get an idea of what
    I want to do.
