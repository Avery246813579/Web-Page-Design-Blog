    <p>I wanted my website to have a clean and simple look. It seems that's what a lot of websites are transitioning to. The hard part is to find a equilibrium between having it a simple and clean, and unthoughtful lazy look. While I think my current look is more on the latter, I have to continue to work on it until the design looks perfect.</p>

    <p>A challenge I have came across is making sure the website looks good on different platforms. I had to change a lot of the Javascript and Css to make sure the navigation bar is positioned correctly and not overflowing the content. </p>
