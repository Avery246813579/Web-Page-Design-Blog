    <p>Since my last blog update I have mainly just worked on the about page and the gallery page. In particular I got the commands
    working for the console and also a little bit of styling to make it look as authentic as possible. For the gallery page I started
    to add the projects and make it look somewhat decent. I have no final design for the gallery page but hopefully I can find something
    that I like. Below are pictures of each page!</p>

    I have not yet worked on my home or contact page. I think about what I want them to look like.
